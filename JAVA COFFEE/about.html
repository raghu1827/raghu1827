    <h4>JAVA Coffee</h4>
    <p>
      Java means a cup of coffee. Java coffee especially refers to a special
      kind of Arabica coffee bean that is grown on Java Island. However, the
      word Java has different meanings. Technically, Java is a high-level
      computer programming language, but the word also describes many other
      things like a hot cup of coffee, etc.

    <h4>History of Java coffee</h4>
    <p>
      The history of java coffee dates back to 1690 when the Dutch smuggled the
      coffee plant from Arab and started to grow it on an Island named Java in
      Indonesia. At that time, Island java was the main source of coffee in the
      world. The coffee acquired the name Java coffee on the name of Island
      Java, where it was grown first.

    <h4>Meaning of the word Java</h4>
    <p>
      Java means a cup of coffee. Java coffee especially refers to a special
      kind of Arabica coffee bean that is grown on Java Island. However, the
      word Java has different meanings. Technically, Java is a high-level
      computer programming language, but the word also describes many other
      things like a hot cup of coffee, etc. The logo and name of Java
      programming are also based on Java coffee. The logo of Java looked like a
      coffee mug with steam over it. The concept behind this logo is that when
      the engineers were developing the programming language Java, they were
      consuming a lot of coffee named Java coffee beans. And this was the main
      reason that the founder of the programming language named their program
      Java on the name of Java coffee and also created a logo that resembled a
      coffee mug.

    <h4>Story of Java</h4>
    <p>
      Coffee with its different variety In the 1880s, Java Island, when it was
      the world's largest producer of coffee, faced a great loss. A rust plague
      that is started from Sukabumi gradually spread across Central and East
      Java. The plague destroyed the crops of Java coffee and also lost the
      plantation stocks. At that time, Java Island mostly produced Arabica
      coffee beans which are considered the best coffee beans. But, most of the
      plantation stock was lost in the plague, so after the plague, the Dutch
      planted new varieties, first Liberica and after then Robusta. These
      species were disease-resistant but lower in quality than Arabica.
